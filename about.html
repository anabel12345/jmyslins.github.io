            <h1>About the Hato lab</h1>
            <p >The long-term goal of the Hato Laboratory is to develop targeted therapies for acute kidney injury in sepsis. Sepsis-induced kidney injury is associated with high mortality and there is no specific therapy that can be offered at the bedside beyond supportive care. The lack of therapeutic options is due in part to incomplete understanding of the temporal evolution of sepsis pathology.
                Their ongoing research focuses on defining the timeline of sepsis-induced kidney injury using a combination of imaging and sequencing tools. In particular, the investigators in the laboratory are interested in understanding the molecular link between the early phase inflammation and late phase organ shutdown. In parallel, the laboratory seeks to develop novel therapeutic approaches. For example, they have recently reported the first example of protein cage nanoparticle that can be targeted to renal proximal tubules through glomerular filtration.</p>

              <h1>Principal Investigator</h1>
              <p >
               Takashi Hato, MD, completed his postgraduate clinical training in both Japan and the United States. Following his nephrology fellowship training at Indiana University, he worked as a hospitalist for 4 years to fulfill his clinical obligations (J1 waiver). In 2016, he joined the faculty at Indiana University, Division of Nephrology as Assistant Professor of Medicine. Dr. Hato is the recipient of several awards including the Eskenazi Medical Group Hospitalist Citizenship Award and The Indiana University Board of Trustees  Teaching Award. His research interests are centered on the discovery of targeted therapies for sepsis-induced organ failure. His research has been funded by the NIH.
